        Since the earliest days of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the transit system in New York City has been involved in one of the most incredible rebounds of any large public transit system in the world. After falling to single-digit percentages of regular levels in the spring of 2020, ridership not only rebounded—but by 2024-2025, the MTA was celebrating billion-ride markers and recording regular yearly increases to make the term "skyrocketed" a valid description.
      </p>

      <p>
        The trough came early: in April 2020, subway ridership dipped to 8.3% of April 2019 levels as the city shut down and people stayed home. Then came a slow and irregular recovery as telecommuting habits evolved, tourism remained shut out, and concerns about safety kept people away. Yet a striking turnabout started in 2022 and continued into 2023-25. In 2023, total subway passenger trips reached 1.15 billion, a 14% increase over 2022, and reached the billion mark sooner in the year compared to 2022.
      </p>

      <p>
        The momentum kept building. In 2025, the MTA proudly proclaimed it had already counted one billion subway passengers for the year and marked consecutive weekdays with more than four million customers, which indicated a lot more than a revival of commuting – it indicated a reopening of the city. On December 3-4, 2025, it carried about 4.6 million passengers on each of those days, setting a new daily record since the pandemic.

        Pictured above is a chart representing the growth of customers on the subway in particular, with the addition of the Pandemic. The drop was included to display how the New York City Subway went from a struggling transit system, to a thriving commuter empire. The subway has not only helped its own system improve, it benefitted the entirety of the transit network overall.

        This next chart shows how the Metropolitan Transit Authority as a whole grew from the same time period. Most of the statistics that were used stemmed from the subway, according to the MTA. This data is an example of how the subway truly impacted the population and economic growth of the MTA over the past five years. For some, this could be a bit exciting, but for locals, it is nothing short of a nightmare. 
      </p>

      <p>
        According to Karen Rabinowicz, a resident of New York City and an avid subway commuter, she believes that the system has become more crowded since the pandemic ended. She found it a bit stressful, at first, but persisted through tough times to ultimately blend in with reality once again.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I was startled when I first hopped on the train,” she said. “I remember the moment vividly, it was the first day my office re-opened, and it must have been the same case for others. I talked to somebody standing next to me for a brief moment, and he agreed with me. It felt like I was a sardine in a small container, it was jam-packed!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, Rabinowicz still rides the subway every day, with the mindset that her mornings will not become any easier. Even though she dislikes the increase of ridership, she has very few options to get to her job.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The crowds do not scare me, I am still going to take the subway because it is the cheapest, and fastest way for me to get to work,” she stated.  
      </p>

      <p>
        The financial and passenger statistics of the MTA explain the math behind these newspaper headlines. Through November 2025, the year-to-date passenger traffic was well up over 2024, and the non-commuter and commuter groups both outpaced last year’s figures. The MTA’s own metrics also reveal positive ongoing efforts to enhance service operation because there was a record-high level of on-time performance for the agency in 2025.
      </p>

      <p>
        But why the surge? A combination of factors contributed to the simultaneous increase in riders. Employers shifted from pandemic-era fully remote work back to hybrid or office-based schedules, leading to the return of the weekday commuter pattern, the backbone of rail revenue. The return of tourism and convention business filled the seats in cultural institutions and sports stadiums. The congestion-pricing scheme in New York (in place since January 2025) and resulting reductions in traffic appear to have encouraged drivers to turn to public transit, as official metrics reflect gains in bus and subway riders since the congestion-pricing zone went into operation. At last, verifiable improvements in service, including on-time arrivals and a visible enforcement effort against fare evasion, made the system more competitive.
      </p>

      <p>
        In any event, however, “skyrocketed” does not mean an absolute return to 2019 normals for every factor or locality. Systemwide averages conceal disparities: certain bus routes or BOR lines have trailed in terms of recovering from COVID relative to Manhattan, while commuter rail operations, such as the LIRR and Metro-North have progressed according to schedules driven by changes in suburban commuting patterns. Further, this growth in actual riders has occurred in tandem with operating-budget issues for the authority—the eternal fare evade, capital expenses, etc., that continues to surround farebox revenues despite recovering somewhat.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are broader societal and policy implications at play. A bolstered focus on mass transit helps with decarbonization, easing congestion, and reconnecting lower-income, transit-dependent communities with jobs and opportunities. However, there is also a recognition that, in order for the MTA to continue its success, there must be continued focus on capital improvements and a focus on fixing inequities in fare policy, service in lower-income areas, and safety. The choices made now will affect how well the "skyrocketing" patronage helps create a sustainable and accessible transit system for future generations.
